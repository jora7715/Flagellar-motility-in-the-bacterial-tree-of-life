# Flagellar-motility-in-the-bacterial-tree-of-life
This project explored the taxonomic distribution and life history strategies associated with flagellar motility in bacteria. The prevalence of flagellar motility was investigated in bacterial communities spanning gradients in soil carbon availability.
